# cesium-color-helper
A short JavaScript code to turn 16x16 images into blocks of text that work with Cesium for the TI-84 Plus CE. Open it at https://onlymx13.github.io/cesium-color-helper. This will convert the image to 16x16 first, so no need to worry about that.
# How to Use in a Program
Put :DCS in the first line of the program. There will be two colons there. Then put a " in the second line and paste in the text from this tool there. This should all be part of the output so just paste it in TI-Connect CE. Then put the rest of your program on line 3 and below. Save it and send it to a real calculator or CEmu (github.com/CE-Programming/CEmu).
